## About this project

During our PhD thesis, we have found that there is a lack of Java libraries
that implement search algorithms with an extensible, flexible and simple to use model.
Moreover, most of the libraries rely on graph structures or recursive implementations
which do not offer fine-grained control over the
algorithm. This is why we decided to make our little contribution in this field.
Although Hipster is far from being perfect, we hope you find it useful.

Hipster was originally created and is currently maintained by:

-   **Pablo Rodriguez-Mier** - Computer Science PhD student at CITIUS.
-   **Adrian Gonzalez-Sieira** - Computer Science PhD student at CITIUS.

The scientific supervisors of this project are listed below:

-   **Dr. Manuel Mucientes**
-   **Dr. Manuel Lama**
-   **Dr. Alberto BugarÃ­n**

### Citation

The project was also accepted in the 9th Iberian Conference on Information Systems and Technologies (CISTI), 2014.
