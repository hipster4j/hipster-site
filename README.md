# Hipster Web

This is the source code of the [main web site](http://www.hipster4j.org). The site is built using Yeoman, Grunt and Assemble.

## Build

You need node and npm to install the web page. Once installed, run the following command in the project directory
to install all the dependencies with `npm`:

`$ npm install`

Then, compile and run the web page with:
 
`$ grunt server`

Done!
